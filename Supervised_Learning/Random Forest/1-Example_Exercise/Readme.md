### Dataset - 1 :

**1. Breast Cancer Data**

**2. Data Set Information:**

     Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast 
     mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional 
     space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming 
     Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992,
     23-34].

### Dataset - 2 :

**1. Titanic Data**

   https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

**2. Data Set Information:**

    The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  
    On April 15, 1912, during her maiden   voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with 
    an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy 
    shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
    
    One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not
    enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck 
    involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than 
    others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

    We want to study what are characteristics of those who survived and who didn't.
